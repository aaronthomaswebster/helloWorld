A simple implemntation of a hello world program in JavaScipt.

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}
I created this software to begin my personal software portfolio.  I am learning how to create a simple software project that I can use to demonstrate my skills to potential employers.

A simple hello world program is a good place to start because it is simple and easy to understand.  It is also a good way to learn how to use a version control system like Git.
