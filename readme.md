# Overview

A simple implemntation of a hello world program in JavaScipt.

I created this software to begin my personal software portfolio.  I am learning how to create a simple software project that I can use to demonstrate my skills to potential employers.

A simple hello world program is a good place to start because it is simple and easy to understand.  It is also a good way to learn how to use a version control system like Git.

You can view a demonstartion of this project on my YouTube Channel [here](https://youtu.be/kCZWGgfZPzE).

# Development Environment

To develop this project, I used Visual Studio Code.  I used the Node.js runtime environment to run the program.  I used Git and GitHub to manage the source code.

I used the programming language JavaScript to write the program.
